# ShoppingCart Exercise
This application contains a product list of groceries that can be added to a shopping cart. When selected, the specific grocery is added to the cart, with the checkout total dynamically changing to reflect the addition of the new product, while reducing the in stock value by 1. There also contains a restock option that retrieves data from Strapi using an API. The new, restocked products are added to the product list and can be interacted with in the same way as the default products.

## How to Run?
Download the files to a local folder and run using http-server. 

## Roadmap of Future Impovements
Once a product is out of stock, I would like the user-interface to be more obvious, with graying out the product or having out of stock in red. I would also like to add to the quantity of any pre-existing/in stock products, rather than having two items that are the same with one out of stock, and one in stock.
